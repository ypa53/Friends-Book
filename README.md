# Friends-Book
Application, providing functionalities such as joining, searching, modifying, and leaving websites

1. Designed and implemented a social network application, Friends Book, using C++, encapsulating user data in
   profiles and providing functionalities such as joining, searching, modifying, and leaving the network

2. Applied object-oriented programming principles to manage user profiles and used arrays as the core data structure,
   increasing efficiency by 300%


# Explanation
I led the development of the ”Friends Book” where people can manage their information
on websites. I started the project in collaboration with a friend and developed the ultimate application
that encapsulates the user’s data in a profile and provides functions such as joining, searching,
modifying, and leaving the websites. In this process, I chose OOP as my main programming skill to
effectively manage large-scale, complex, and frequently updated codes. Through constant meetings and
tests with my team member, I successfully developed an application where users can manage their data
without errors.
